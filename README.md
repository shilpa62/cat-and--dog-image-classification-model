# cat-and--dog-image-classification-model
 The data set consists of 10000 images of dogs and cats. we have to create a model that classify the images into different categories
 and labelled them as 1 for cat and 0 for dog.
- first I create a model using multilayer perceptron and the model has an accuracy of 49%
- after this I tried to create a model using convolution layer , max pooling layer and dropout layer . The model now reach an acurracy of 79% .
- In the last  commit , by using the concept of transfer learning(using VGG16)  the model has an accuracy of 85%  .
